Today almost everything is digitalized and automated, where business, academic, scientific and economic world revolve around the exchange of information. That’s where authentication comes into place. authentication is a process of validating the user’s identity. Users are identified using different authentication mechanism. to authenticate users of information systems, there are well-known techniques. The first group of such methods is based on checking the knowledge of the user based on some memorized secrets (e.g., secret combination password). In the authentication process, knowledge of this secret is validated. The second group of authentication methods is based on checking the user ownership of certain hardware which becomes the subject (device), such as a smart card or USB token. The device contains the base secret of the user (e.g., its private key digital signature), which does not need to remember. Third party authentication methods are based on checking whether a user has characteristics that could not be separated from it. These characteristics, for example, can be printing finger, face, or voice. Such methods are related to biometric authentications. But all these methods are as effective as possible in local authentication, when there is no doubt about the source of information for user authentication. If remote authentication has no such confidence, because data for verification can be provided to outsider, you want to create new authentication methods, suitable for use in remote access to information systems. These methods can be used in addition to the existing methods of authentication. Additional authentication methods, for example, are to verify a user based on the knowledge test about his preferences and
